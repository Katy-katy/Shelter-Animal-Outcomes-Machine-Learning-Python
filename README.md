# Shelter Animal Outcomes uning python, ipython notebook, pandas, seaborn, sklearn, matplotlib


This project was written for a Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes/data 
My goal was to predict the outcome of the animal as they leave the Animal Center.
We use the date comes from Austin Animal Center (October 1st, 2013 - March, 2016). 
Outcomes represent the status of animals as they leave the Animal Center.

I used multi class logistic regression for this project and got log_loss 0.92871. I also did some useful observations.
Neutered Male and Spayed Female have a great chance to be adopted, but it is very hard to find new family for Intact Male and Intact Female!
It is important for an animal to have an ID tag (I think that the shelter staff learned the names from the tags. The animals with unknown names have almost no chance to return to owners and have less chance to be adopted.
